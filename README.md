# Generating Terrain Models using the Stream Power Law

The study of how landscapes form and evolve has been studied in the field of geomorphology
for many years and has applications in environmental planning, entertainment and beyond. In
this project, a software system was implemented which applies the stream power law from
geomorphology to a graph-based terrain model. The system produces geologically consistent
and realistic terrain models through the simulation of fluvial erosion. The realism of the
produced terrains was then evaluated. The effect of the parameters of the stream power law
on terrain generation were also analysed and the performance of the system over different
parameters was evaluated.
